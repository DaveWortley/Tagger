# Tagger
Maxscript | Tagging tool designed to help organize 3ds Max scenes.

Usage:
- Run Tagger.ms and it will assign the def rollout to all nodes in the scene.

ToDo:
- Create proper callback which addes the def to nodes it doesn't already exist on.
- Create a callback system which adds the def to merged or newly created nodes.

Warning:
- This is not an official release. It's a work in progress and I'm looking for anyone who is interest to help develop this.
